# Jeu du Pendu - Hangman Game

Project started for fun, the objective is to refresh c# knowledge and occupy my free time with development and try to optimise and add new concepts.

## V1
- [x] We have 2 default words : Hello, World
- [x] We can find or not find the word
- [x] Custom message when we win or don't find the word

## v2
- [ ] Possibility to use external file for words
- [x] Restart a new game
- [ ] Add a difficulty system
    - easy: current system
    - medium: time global
    - hard: limit of failures allowed to the size of the word
    
## v3
- [ ] Create commandes for the console
> Example: to display the help write `./hanggame.exe -h`
